SCOPE:
Online University Management System is developing for general purpose and used to replace old paper work system and PUMS. OUMS is to build upon the existing information system PUMS in order to efficiently provide student information to teachers and College administration. This increase in efficiency of result making, provide notices to students, give feedback to student, finally, publication and email student result.
The system will maintain 3 categories of user accounts in performing the tasks. They are namely “Super user”, “Administrator” and “Student”.   
The Super User is given supreme privileges in the system and therefore is able to do anything in the system. She/he will also control the privilege access matrix of Administrator and Student accounts. The Administrators are of different levels of privilege depending on the tasks they perform. The administrators are entitled to manage other user accounts, to make amendments to subjects, to add new subjects and also to view student details.  Students are of the lowest privilege level with only being able to view previous and current semester information and to view notifications and marks. 
All 3 categories of users must login to the system with the user name and the password to perform any of the operations. Other than the above mentioned 3 user categories the system will also allow guest users. However, the guest users can only view the results of a particular student by entering the student registration number and the index number. 
Since the existing registration process is a manual one, the proposed Student Registration System will increase the efficiency of the registration process quite significantly while providing time and cost benefits. Furthermore, it will provide a sophisticated system for the enrolment thus enhancing the decision-making process of the administration.
